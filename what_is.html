    <h1>What is HyperText</h1>

    <p>
        Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.</br>
        Hypertext is text which contains links to other texts. The term was coined by Ted Nelson around 1965 (see History). HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and sound , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too. Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.
