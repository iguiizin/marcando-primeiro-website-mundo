<body>
    <h1>General Overview</h1>
    <p>
        There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>by Subject</dt>
        <dd>A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use.</dd>

        <dt>by Type</dt>
        <dd>Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also: About the W3 project.</h2>
